This is the first project made from theodinproject.com
The only language used is HTML with some basic concepts that include:
- Headers (h1, h2, h3, etc)
- Paragraphs (p)
- Images with alt text (img)
- Links to other pages (index.html to taco-pie.html, etc)
- Unordered and ordered lists (ul / ol)
There are a few other concepts learned to create this such as:
- Learning to use the terminal (navigation, making folders, etc)
- Learning how to use GIT (How to push, how to name, etc)
