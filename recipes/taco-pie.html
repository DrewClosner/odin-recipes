    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons bold taco seasoning</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat over to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-inch pan.</li>
        <li>
            Break up ground beef into a 10-inch skillet over medium heat; sprinkle on bold taco 
            seasoning. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 
            minutes. Place beef in the bottom of the prepared pie pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk eggs, cream, and granulated garlic together in a bowl until well combined; 
            pour eggs over beef. Sprinkle grated Cheddar cheese evenly over the top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the center of the preheated oven until the eggs are set and cheese is melted, 
            about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack for about 5 minutes.
